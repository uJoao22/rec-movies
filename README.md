# Rec Movies
Responsive academic web project for a movie site called Rec Movies. It was developed in 2020 with just one month of study in the technical course. Technologies used: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. In order not to get too heavy, the file was only posted to the pages of the first 10 movies that are in the recommended tab, but it doesn't interfere at all in viewing the site's design, just don't try to enter the other movies page, it will give an error because the page is not posted.

It is possible to have a good view of this project through GitHub Pages. </br>

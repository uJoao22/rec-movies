# Rec Movies
Responsive academic web project for a movie site called Rec Movies. It was developed in 2020 with just one month of study in the technical course. Technologies used: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. In order not to get too heavy, the file was only posted on the pages of the first 10 movies that are in the recommended tab, but it doesn't interfere in anything with the visualization of the site's design.

It is possible to have a good view of this project through GitHub Pages. </br>

# Rec Movies
Responsive academic web project for a movie site called Rec Movies. It was developed in 2020 with just one month of study in the technical course. Technologies used: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. In order not to get too heavy, the file only went up the pages of the movies that are on the recommended tab, but it doesn't interfere in any way with the site's design visualization.

It is possible to have a good view of this project through GitHub Pages. </br>
